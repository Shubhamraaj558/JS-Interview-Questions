                                      JavaScript Interview Question


Q1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

Ans:- "==" (Equality Operator): This operator checks for equality of values but performs type coercion if the types are different.
       For example, 5 == '5' will return true because the string '5' is coerced to a number.

      "===" (Strict Equality Operator): This operator checks for both value and type equality without performing type coercion.
       For example, 5 === '5' will return false because the types (number and string) are different.

Q2. What are the differences between var, let and const?

Ans:- var:
        Function-scoped or globally scoped.
        Can be re-declared and updated.
        Hoisted to the top of its scope, but initialized with undefined.

        let:
        Block-scoped (limited to the block in which it is defined).
        Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
        Also hoisted, but not initialized.

        const:
        Block-scoped.
        Cannot be updated or re-declared.
        Must be initialized at the time of declaration.
        The reference is constant, but if it points to an object or array, the contents can still be modified.

Q3.What is execution context.

Ans:-Execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed. It includes:

    The value of this.
    The variable environment (scope).
    The lexical environment (the scope chain).

Q4.What is creation phase and execution phase.

Ans:- "Creation Phase": This is the first phase of the execution context where:
        Memory is allocated for variables and functions.
        Variables are hoisted (declared but not initialized).
        The scope chain is established.

      "Execution Phase": This is the second phase where:
        The code is executed line by line.
        Variables are assigned their values.
        Functions are invoked.

Q5.What is hoisting?

Ans:- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations 
      are moved to the top of their containing scope during the creation phase. 
      This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the 
      code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

Q6.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN

Ans :-"undefined": A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is undefined. It is a type itself.

       "not defined": This error occurs when you try to access a variable that has not been declared at all in the 
        current scope. For example, console.log(x) where x has never been declared will throw a ReferenceError.

        "NaN (Not-a-Number)": This is a special value that represents a computational error when a value is not a valid number. 
        For example, parseInt("abc") will return NaN.

Q7.How many operators do we have in JS ? 

Ans :-JavaScript has several types of operators, including:
        Arithmetic Operators
        Assignment Operators
        Comparison Operators
        Logical Operators
        Bitwise Operators
        Unary Operators
        Ternary Operator
        Type Operators

Q8.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript.

Ans:-   Local Scope: Refers to variables that are defined within a function. These variables are not accessible outside of that function.

        Block Scope: Introduced with let and const, block scope refers to variables that are defined within a block (e.g., within {} braces). 
        These variables are not accessible outside of that block.

        Functional Scope: This is similar to local scope, where variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function. 
        Functions create their own scope.

        Scope Chain: This is the mechanism by which JavaScript resolves variable names. When a variable is referenced, JavaScript looks for it 
        in the current scope, and if it’s not found, it moves up the scope chain to the outer scopes until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope.
